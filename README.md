## What is the royal game of Ur ?

[The royal game of ur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur) is an ancient board game, probably played by the
Babylonians 5000 years ago. Various versions of the game and rules have been found and proposed. This board-game uses
a simplified version of the rule I've based mostly [on the video which popularized the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZskjLq040I)

If anyone feels like an alternative ruleset could be included or the current ruleset could be improved feel free to create
and issue and detail on your proposal.
